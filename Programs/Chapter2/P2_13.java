/*
Write a program that reads a number between 1,000 and 999,999 from the user,
where the user enters a comma in the input. Then print the number without a
comma. Here is a sample dialog; the user input is in color:
Please enter an integer between 1,000 and 999,999: 23,456
23456
Hint: Read the input as a string. Measure the length of the string. Suppose it contains
n characters. Then extract substrings consisting of the first n â€“ 4 characters and the
last three characters.
