/*
Writing large letters. A large letter H can be produced like this:
 *   *
 *   *
 *****
 *   *
 *   *
It can be declared as a string literal like this:
final string LETTER_H = "*   *\n*   *\n*****\n*   *\n*   *\n";
(The \n escape sequence denotes a “newline” character that causes subsequent
characters to be printed on a new line.) Do the same for the letters E , L , and O . Then
write the message
H
E
L
L
O
in large letters.
