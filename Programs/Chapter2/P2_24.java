/*
The following pseudocode describes how to extract the dollars and cents from a
price given as a floating-point value. For example, a price 2.95 yields values 2 and 95
for the dollars and cents.
Assign the price to an integer variable dollars.
Multiply the difference price - dollars by 100 and add 0.5.
Assign the result to an integer variable cents.
