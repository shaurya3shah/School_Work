/*Write a program to simulate a bank transaction. There are two bank accounts: check­
ing and savings. First, ask for the initial balances of the bank accounts; reject nega­
tive balances. Then ask for the transactions; options are deposit, withdrawal, and
transfer. Then ask for the account; options are checking and savings. Then ask for the
amount; reject transactions that overdraw an account. At the end, print the balances
of both accounts.*/
