/*Calculating the tip when you go to a restaurant is not difficult, but your restaurant
wants to suggest a tip according to the service diners receive. Write a program that
calculates a tip according to the diner’s satisfaction as follows:
•    Ask for the diners’ satisfaction level using these ratings: 1 = Totally satisfied, 2
= Satisfied, 3 = Dissatisfied.
•    If the diner is totally satisfied, calculate a 20 percent tip.
•    If the diner is satisfied, calculate a 15 percent tip.
•    If the diner is dissatisfied, calculate a 10 percent tip.
•    Report the satisfaction level and tip in dollars and cents.*/
