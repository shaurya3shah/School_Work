/*A supermarket awards coupons depending on how much a customer spends on
 groceries. For example, if you spend $50, you will get a coupon worth eight percent
 of that amount. The following table shows the percent used to calculate the coupon
 awarded for different amounts spent. Write a program that calculates and prints the
 value of the coupon a person can receive based on groceries purchased.
 Here is a sample run:
 Please enter the cost of your groceries: 14
 You win a discount coupon of $ 1.12. (8% of your purchase)*/
