/*Write a program that prompts for the day and month of the userâ€™s birthday and then
prints a horoscope. Make up fortunes for programmers, like this:
Please enter your birthday (month and day): 6 16
Gemini are experts at figuring out the behavior of complicated programs.
You feel where bugs are coming from and then stay one step ahead. Tonight,
your style wins approval from a tough critic.
Each fortune should contain the name of the astrological sign. (You will find the
names and date ranges of the signs at a distressingly large number of sites on the
Internet.)*/
