/*Write a program that reads in the name and salary of an employee. Here the salary
 will denote an hourly wage, such as $9.25. Then ask how many hours the employee
 worked in the past week. Be sure to accept fractional hours. Compute the pay. Any
 overtime work (over 40 hours per week) is paid at 150 percent of the regular wage.
 Print a paycheck for the employee.*/
