/*When two points in time are compared, each given as hours (in military time, rangÂ­ing
from 0 and 23) and minutes, the following pseudocode determines which comes first.
If hour1 < hour2
     time1 comes first.
Else if hour1 and hour2 are the same
     If minute1 < minute2
         time1 comes first.
     Else if minute1 and minute2 are the same
         time1 and time2 are the same.
     Else
         time2 comes first.
Else
     time2 comes first.
Write a program that prompts the user for two points in time and prints the time that
comes first, then the other time.*/
