/*Roman numbers. Write a program that converts a positive integer into the Roman
 number system. The Roman number system has digits
     I 1
     V 5
     X 10
     L 50
     C 100
     D 500
     M 1,000
 Numbers are formed according to the following rules:
     a.  Only numbers up to 3,999 are represented.
     b.  As in the decimal system, the thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones are ex­
     pressed separately.
     c.  The numbers 1 to 9 are expressed as
         I  1
         II  2
         III  3
         IV  4
         V  5
         VI  6
         VII  7
         VIII  8
         IX  9
         As you can see, an I preceding a V or X is subtracted from the value, and you
         can never have more than three I’s in a row.
     d.  Tens and hundreds are done the same way, except that the letters X, L, C and C,
         D, M are used instead of I, V, X, respectively.
 Your program should take an input, such as 1978, and convert it to Roman numerals,
