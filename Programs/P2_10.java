/*
Write a program that helps a person decide whether to buy a hybrid car. Your
pro­gram’s inputs should be:
•    The cost of a new car
•    The estimated miles driven per year
•    The estimated gas price
•    The efficiency in miles per gallon
•    The estimated resale value after 5 years
Compute the total cost of owning the car for five years.
(For simplic­ity, we will not take the cost of financing into account.)
Obtain realistic prices for a new and used hybrid
and a com­parable car from the Web. Run your program twice, using today’s gas
price and 15,000 miles per year. Include pseudocode and the program runs with your
assignment.
