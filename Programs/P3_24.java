/*Unit conversion. Write a unit conversion program that asks the users from which
unit they want to convert (fl. oz, gal, oz, lb, in, ft, mi) and to which unit they want to
convert (ml, l, g, kg, mm, cm, m, km). Reject incompatible conversions
(such as gal â†’ km). Ask for the value to be converted, then display the result:
Convert from? gal
Convert to? ml
Value? 2.5
2.5 gal = 9462.5 ml*/
