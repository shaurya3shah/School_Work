/*When you use an automated teller machine (ATM) with your bank card, you need
 to use a personal identification number (PIN) to access your account. If a user fails
 more than three times when entering the PIN, the machine will block the card.
 Assume that the user’s PIN is “1234” and write a program that asks the user for the
 PIN no more than three times, and does the following:
 •    If the user enters the right number, print a message saying, “Your PIN is
 correct”, and end the program.
 •    If the user enters a wrong number, print a message saying, “Your PIN is
 incorrect” and, if you have asked for the PIN less than three times, ask for it
 again.
 •    If the user enters a wrong number three times, print a message saying “Your
 bank card is blocked” and end the program.*/
