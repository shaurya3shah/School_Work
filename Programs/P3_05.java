/*Write a program that reads three numbers and prints “increasing” if they are in
increasing order, “decreasing” if they are in decreasing order, and “neither” other­
wise. Here, “increasing” means “strictly increasing”, with each value larger than its
pre­decessor. The sequence 3 4 4 would not be considered increasing.*/
